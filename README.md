**An autonomous AI agent that never sleeps, continuously hunting vulnerable smart contracts on NEAR mainnet to protect the DeFi ecosystem from rug pulls and security exploits.**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

The NEAR DeFi ecosystem faces constant threats:
- **New malicious contracts** deployed daily
- **Rug pulls** draining millions from unsuspecting users
- **Security vulnerabilities** in legitimate contracts
- **Manual auditing** can't keep up with deployment speed
- **Users have no real-time protection** against emerging threats

**Current solutions are reactive, not proactive.**
